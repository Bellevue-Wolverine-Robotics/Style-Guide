# Repository and File Naming Convention

Repository names should use <b>Upper-Kebab-Case</b>, using hyphens in place of spaces between words, and having the first letter of each word be capitalized.

.java source files should be named exactly the same as the class name, which should be PascalCase.

Folders should use follow package naming conventions — <b>snake_case</b>, using underscores in place of spaces and having every letter be lowercase.
